    "text": "Project Overview\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture from https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/\nThis project draws on the vast and dynamic discussions about soccer in various Reddit communities. Our exploration is not just a study of the game of soccer, but a deep dive into the cultural, social, and emotional landscapes surrounding the game. At the core of our efforts is an understanding of the pulse of soccer fans around the world as captured in Reddit conversations.\nOur goal was to identify the soccer topics that people talk about the most in different subreddits, from tactics and league policy to fan culture and transfers, and how these topics resonate with the Reddit community. Another key goal was to capture the sentiment of soccer fans, especially for major events like the 2022 World Cup, and track how those sentiments evolve over time. We sought to dive into the nuances of online discourse and reveal the drivers of a post’s popularity or controversy. This includes understanding what makes a post engaging or divisive among soccer fans. We are also interested in Reddit’s broader patterns of activity in the soccer community, such as which days see the most interactions and how this relates to real-world soccer events like game days.\nEssentially, our project is an overview of the soccer-related digital footprint on Reddit. It seeks to analyze the collective voice of soccer fans around the world and gain insights into their preferences, emotions, and behaviors. This project not only enriches our understanding of soccer as a global phenomenon, but also demonstrates the power of online platforms like Reddit to shape and reflect public opinion and sentiment."

Extract Reddit posts from a diverse set of subreddits listed in the dictionary. Subsequently, calculate the post count for each subreddit and visualize the findings using a bar plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal: Determine which days of the week see the most activity from soccer fans, and whether this is driven by match days.\nTechnical Proposal: Get external soccer match schedule and data for the same time frame, filter and merge the Reddit activity data with the match schedule data based on the date. Count daily posts and comments in soccer subreddits, flag days with matches using the external database, and assess the relationship between match days and activity spikes. For visualization methods, illustrate the volume of posts/comments over time and compare average daily activity on match days versus non-match days.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness goal: Identify what aspects of soccer are most frequently discussed in different subreddits and what kind of topics are most likely to acquire high scores.\nTechnical proposal: Use NLP to identify the posts that mention different aspects of soccer, including tactics, league policies, transfers or fan culture. Then count the number of posts and calculate the average score of each aspect. Create several plots, like pie charts or bar plots, to visualize the count number and score of the most popular topics.\n\nNLP\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal: Identify the teams or players linked to the highest levels of toxicity in Reddit conversations.\nTechnical Proposal: Create a manual dictionary mapping major team and league names to their respective subreddit names. Gather Reddit posts from a variety of subreddits listed in the dictionary. Establish a processing pipeline to clean and tokenize the text of these posts. Train a toxicity content classifier using a labeled dataset obtained from Kaggle. Apply the trained model to the preprocessed posts and visualize the results using a bar plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal: Determine if there is a relationship between the changes of sentiment in soccer subreddits and major events (e.g., wins, losses, transfers).\nTechnical Proposal: Match the Reddit data with key soccer events using dates and team/player mentions. Utilize NLP techniques to assign sentiment scores to each post and comment, and label the dataset with sentiment scores. Investigate sentiment before, during, and after major events. Display sentiment trends over time with event markers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness goal: Examine how soccer fans feel about the 2022 World Cup, and how their feelings evolve over time.\nTechnical proposal: First extract all the posts relevant to the 2022 World Cup from all the available records. Then apply sentiment analysis for each post to examine the feeling towards the World Cup. Finally track the sentiment over time to see how soccer fans’ feelings change.\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal: Predict the Popularity of Reddit Posts in Soccer Subreddits, Considering Multiple Factors\nTechnical Proposal: Collect Reddit posts from diverse soccer-related subreddits and analyze various factors, including time of day, day of the week, and the presence of URLs, among others, to forecast a post’s popularity. Convert time-related data into numeric formats and convert categorical label variables, such as URL presence, into binary dummy variables. For the target column, establish a threshold, such as a specified number of comments, to distinguish between popular and non-popular posts, encoding it as a binary variable. Subsequently, develop a classification model to predict the likelihood of a post becoming popular upon submission to Reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal: Predict the outcome of upcoming games based on the sentiment or volume of the discussions before the games.\nTechnical Proposal: Use historical game outcome records to serve as training labels for the model. Merge sentiment and volume metrics with historical game outcomes based on the date and teams playing, and select relevant features that contribute to predictive accuracy (e.g., sentiment score, volume of posts, time series data). Experiment with various ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, SVM, neural networks) to find the best performer, use cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance. Evaluate the percentage of correct predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness goal: Develop a machine learning-based solution to predict the controversiality of social media posts using their textual content and user engagement scores.\nTechnical proposal: Implement a machine learning model that integrates Natural Language Processing to analyze the textual content of posts (‘body’) and numerical analysis of engagement scores. Utilize logistic regression to categorize posts into controversial or non-controversial, leveraging insights about the interplay between content and user interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness goal: Determine whether unsupervised models can be utilized to divide the users into different fan bases.\nTechnical proposal: Apply NLP to extract the posts related to soccer. Then convert the body message into multiple dummy variables indicating the presence and frequency of certain words and topics. Leverage clustering algorithms to divide the unique users into different groups and identify the common features within each group. Examine whether these groups are consistent with the existing fan bases in the world."

There are similar traits in the two lines, for example on 2023-01-30 and 2023-01-31 there are few to none matches played, and the comments count on Reddit for these two days are also low; For every few days there are two days where around 20 matches are played, and on these days the number of Reddit comments also peaked. This time series line charts therefore show some degree of correlation between the number of comments and matches for each day.\nTo track down the correlation, the correlation coefficient metric between the number of comments and matches each day was calculated to be 0.614. Since 0.614 is not a large number, we can say that the two counts are moderately positively correlated. To further explore this, a scatter plot between the two counts along with a regression line is shown below.\n\n\nScatter Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Daily Number of Reddit Comments vs. Number of Matches\n\n\n\n\nBased on the scatter plot, the regression line shows that there is a positive relation between the number of matches and reddit comments per day, and the correlation is moderately strong."

Unlike the average score distribution of each topic, the gild percentage of the topics show greater variety. Posts related to Player Performances or Match Analysis and Previews tend to have higher probabilities to be gilded. Also, it is interesting that although the number of posts about Match Analysis and Previews are smaller than other topics, the gild percentage of this topic is the highest among all."

Toxicity peaks on weekends and mid-week, aligning with league and UEFA games, but dips during national team matches, indicating fluctuating fan behavior.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 2:\nThe NLP analysis proves that there are relationships between the sentiment scores of fans’ comments and the match results. The analysis examines the sentiment situation of fans of Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea, and the results indicate that the fans of all three clubs were showing mostly negative moods, especially when the team lost or tied in a match.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 3:\nThis NLP analysis suggests that of all the sub-topics about the World Cup 2022, people discussed the players most frequently. Additionally, a large amount of people might not be satisfied with certain judgments from the referees during the World Cup. It is also noticeable that people’s general attitude towards the World Cup 2022 did not change much over time."

It is understandable the Atletico has the highest toxicity score since the it is widely known as one of the most violent clubs in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Average Toxic Score of Different Days of Week \n  \n    \n      \n      day_of_week\n      average_toxic_score\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1.259511\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      1.119115\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1.155359\n    \n    \n      3\n      4\n      1.196851\n    \n    \n      4\n      5\n      1.204669\n    \n    \n      5\n      6\n      1.126858\n    \n    \n      6\n      7\n      1.248906\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe also found that different days of week have different level of toxicity score. On weekends, the toxic comments are more than weekdays since league games are played on weekends so people tend to have hostile comments during and after games. It is noticeable that the scores on Wednesday and Thursday is also relatively higher because UEFA Champions League and Europa League played on these days.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average Toxic Score Change (Jan 2023 - Mar 2023)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the lineplot, the weekly periodic pattern is obvious, which has been proved by the table of toxicity score for different days of week. Instead of club games, national team games were held from March 20 to March 28 so the toxicity is fairly low during this time.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 2: Determine if there is a relationship between the changes of sentiment in soccer subreddits and match results (e.g., wins, losses).\nExternal Data Source: Match Result Data\nTo implement this task, first match the Reddit data of the most commented clubs with soccer matches result data using dates. Utilize NLP techniques to assign sentiment scores to each post and comment, and label the dataset with sentiment scores. Investigate sentiment before, during, and after matches. Display sentiment trends over time with event markers and align with match results to study the relationship between these two events.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sentiment of Arsenal Fans\n\n\n\n\nThis is a combined line and bar plot, showing the number of comments from Arsenal fans of positive and negative sentiments as lines, and the match result as bars (also showing the average number of positive and negative comments on matchdays).\nWe can draw some interesting findings from this sentiment analysis: First, on the date when there was a match for Arsenal the comments number are much higher than the days when there was no match; Second, Arsenal fans tend to have rather balanced sentiments in their comments when there is no matches, however when Arsenal lost or draw a game, the number of negative comments are always higher than the positive comments, many times much higher. Even when Arsenal won, the fans did not really show much more positivity, sometimes even more negative when a match was won. Consider Arsenal has historically not been doing great during January to March, as they lost their leading position in the premier league in this time in 2023, it is understandable that their fans are not very optimistic.\nIt could be interesting to have a positive/negative ratio for the lines, so a similar chart where the line showing the ratio is added. The plot of single line of the positive/negative comments ratio can be more straightfoward than the plot of 2 lines of both positive and negative comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sentiment Ratio of Arsenal Fans\n\n\n\n\nThis map represents the ratio of number of positive comments to negative comments on each day for Arsenal fans, along with the match results for Arsenal. In this plot, a similar interesting finding is that the days that have the lowest sentiment ratio are always the days that the team lost the match or had a draw. This is a reasonable result, since a bad losing day will make the fans upset. However, it is also found that a winning match day does not always generate a good sentiment ratio, and the highest ratio often happends on non-match days. We can infer from this result that, at least for Arsenal fans, the sentiment is more normal or positive on non-match days. Even if the team is winning, the fans might still be upset about the team’s performance.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 3: Examine how soccer fans feel about the 2022 World Cup, and how their feelings evolve over time.\nThis section analyzes sentiment over time for Reddit comments related to the 2022 World Cup. Firstly, a regex pattern, defined by key words, filters relevant posts. Then, three dummy variables were introduced to determine if posts are related to champions, players, or referees. A pre-trained sentiment analysis model was employed to categorize the sentiment of each post. Here is a resulting cross-tabulation showing the post counts across sentiment categories within each World Cup sub-topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Cross-tabulation of Sentiment Analysis about the World Cup \n  \n    \n      \n      category\n      negative\n      neutral\n      positive\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      champion\n      4976\n      637\n      5414\n    \n    \n      1\n      players\n      19230\n      2104\n      14753\n    \n    \n      2\n      referee\n      3963\n      307\n      1877\n    \n    \n      3\n      total\n      85860\n      8408\n      63339\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nA grouped barplot is also created to visualize the sentiment by category.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Category-wise Sentiment Analysis about the World Cup\n\n\n\n\nThis plot reveals a notably higher post volume about players compared to other sub-topics. Additionally, the champion-related posts had a greater share of positive sentiment, while referee-related posts skewed negative, hinting at dissatisfaction with referees’ decisions.\nIn the subsequent section, sentiment analysis was conducted on a weekly basis, calculating the total, positive, negative, and neutral post counts for each week within the timeframe. Here is a table summarizing this weekly data and a time series plot for visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Weekly Summary Data of Sentiment Analysis about the World Cup \n  \n    \n      \n      week\n      total_posts\n      negative\n      neutral\n      positive\n      positive_percentage(%)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      2023-01-01\n      1611\n      868\n      83\n      660\n      40.968343\n    \n    \n      1\n      2023-01-08\n      12624\n      7095\n      648\n      4881\n      38.664449\n    \n    \n      2\n      2023-01-15\n      12644\n      7010\n      658\n      4976\n      39.354635\n    \n    \n      3\n      2023-01-22\n      12486\n      6883\n      676\n      4927\n      39.460195\n    \n    \n      4\n      2023-01-29\n      10791\n      5666\n      611\n      4514\n      41.831156\n    \n    \n      5\n      2023-02-05\n      8043\n      4374\n      423\n      3246\n      40.358075\n    \n    \n      6\n      2023-02-12\n      12529\n      6796\n      642\n      5091\n      40.633730\n    \n    \n      7\n      2023-02-19\n      15376\n      8656\n      821\n      5899\n      38.364984\n    \n    \n      8\n      2023-02-26\n      12475\n      6697\n      739\n      5039\n      40.392786\n    \n    \n      9\n      2023-03-05\n      11827\n      6126\n      620\n      5081\n      42.961021\n    \n    \n      10\n      2023-03-12\n      12381\n      6655\n      656\n      5070\n      40.949843\n    \n    \n      11\n      2023-03-19\n      14720\n      7740\n      801\n      6179\n      41.976902\n    \n    \n      12\n      2023-03-26\n      12656\n      7183\n      693\n      4780\n      37.768647\n    \n    \n      13\n      2023-04-02\n      7444\n      4111\n      337\n      2996\n      40.247179\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Weekly Sentiment Post Counts and Positive Percentage about the World Cup\n\n\n\n\nThe time series plot shows no distinct trend in post volume throughout the period.

    "text": "2. Conclusions of each part\n\nEDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)\nThe Reddit data on soccer subreddits reveals variations in activity levels among different leagues, with the Premier League and MLS having highest engagement. The most popular clubs like Barcelona and AC Milan generate active discussions, which primarily focus on collective experiences, strategies, and clubs rather than individual players. The analysis of Reddit comments and soccer match data indicates a correlation between comments and matches on certain days, particularly on weekends. Furthermore, six common topics related to soccer are identified, with Player Performances being the most discussed. Surprisingly, Match Analysis and Previews have a high gild percentage despite fewer posts, suggesting a high level of appreciation and engagement in that category.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily Number of Reddit Comments vs. Number of Matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNLP (Natural Language Processing)\nThe analysis of toxicity levels in soccer club subreddits indicates that Atletico’s subreddit has the highest toxicity, which may be due to this club’s violent reputation. Additionally, toxicity levels peak on weekends and mid-week, corresponding with league and UEFA games, but decrease during national team matches. This study investigates sentiment in Reddit comments from Arsenal fans before, during, and after matches. It shows that comment numbers are particularly higher on match days, but the sentiment of these comments are generally more negative, even if the team wins. As for the analysis of sentiment in Reddit comments related to the 2022 World Cup, it reveals that there was notably higher post volume about players compared to other sub-topics. Posts related to the champion had a greater share of positive sentiment, while referee-related posts skewed negative, suggesting dissatisfaction with referees’ decisions. Interestingly, the sentiment analysis shows that general attitudes towards the World Cup did not significantly fluctuate over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Daily Sentiment of Arsenal Fans vs. Arsenal Match Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Category-wise Sentiment Analysis about 2022 World Cup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nML (Machine Learning)\nThis study predicts the popularity of Reddit posts in the soccer subreddit with an accuracy of over 88%. The most influential factor in determining post popularity is the ‘score’ factor (likes minus dislikes), followed by secondary factors like the number of crossposts and title length. In the second part, this study aims to predict the controversiality of social media posts using their textual content and user engagement scores. Two logistic regression models, Model 1 and Model 2, were developed with different hyperparameter configurations. Model 1 is more effective at reducing false positives and is suitable for avoiding mislabeling non-controversial posts, while Model 2 is more sensitive to controversial posts and may be useful when identifying controversial content is critical. As for clustering analysis, the Reddit comments about soccer are divided into five clusters, with one cluster encompassing the majority of comments, particularly related to topics like ‘VAR,’ ‘transfer,’ ‘World Cup,’ and ‘coach.’ The remaining four clusters are associated with ‘Ligue 1,’ ‘Germany,’ ‘Europa,’ and ‘Ballon’ respectively. In the last part of machine learning, this study explores the use of Reddit comments and scores from fans of three popular soccer teams to predict the match results of their favorite teams. By employing logistic regression on comment scores and vectorized text bodies, the model achieves an accuracy of around 70% in forecasting match outcomes, with higher precision in predicting wins compared to losses, which suggests that fan opinions on Reddit can provide some insight into match outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Feature Importance of Post Popularity Classification Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Average Feature Values per Cluster"

    "text": "3. Next steps in the future\nLooking into future, there are several updates that can be made to our project. Due to the limited resources on the big data processing stage, we could still perform more detailed data cleaning, filtering and extracting on the original big data set, so that for each topic a more accurate data table can be used. For instance, we explored what are the most popular clubs on Reddit, and the number of comments from each club’s subreddit were counted. In the future, the comments from the big r/soccer subreddit can also be used for this topic, as the flair information in the original dataset can be used to determine a fan. However, this require more data cleaning and more time, so it can be an improvement in the next steps.\nThe same applies to the topic where machine learning methods are utilized to predict the trends in the comments or the match results. Since a good machine learning model requires reliable data, decent feature engineering and necessary hyper-parameter tuning processes, it takes resources to perform these steps. Also, training model on big data is time consuming as well, so as for future steps, the goal could be spending appropriate time and resources on finding some high performance machine learning model on the Reddit Archive data set."

This model is intended to identify key factors that contribute to increasing comment activity, serving as a guide for Reddit users to enhance the popularity of their posts. Our chosen methodology utilizes the random forest classifier, implemented through the “pyspark.ml” package. The process began with the collection of submission data from the soccer subreddit. Key features included in the analysis were post length and a binary indicator for nighttime posting. A pipeline was established to vectorize the training data and to construct the random forest model. Grid search and cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize the model, leading to the selection of a random forest model with 50 trees and a maximum depth of 15. The model demonstrated a high level of accuracy, achieving a test accuracy of 0.8893. In terms of feature importance, which is based on the reduction in impurity, the ‘score’ factor (likes minus dislikes) emerged as the most influential. Secondary factors, such as the number of crossposts and title length, had a significant but lesser impact. Other contributing factors included posts authored by administrators, those containing videos, or with enabled previews, each showing a moderate increase in popularity. Conversely, the time of publishing and the presence of adult content were found to be less influential in determining post popularity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Feature Importance\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of feature importance, which is based on the reduction in impurity, the ‘score’ factor (likes minus dislikes) emerged as the most influential.

The logistic regression approach provided a clear baseline with the advantage of interpretability. Initially, the data was filtered out and the body of each post was converted from list to vector, next developed two logistic regression models with distinct hyperparameter configurations.\n\nModel 1: Featured a regularization parameter (regParam) of 0.1 and a maximum iteration count (maxIter) of 10.\nModel 2: Had a regParam of 0.01 and maxIter of 20.\n\nThe models were evaluated on several metrics: ROC AUC, Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Classification Report for Test Data \n  \n    \n      \n      Model 1\n      Model 2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      ROC AUC\n      0.654257\n      0.621271\n    \n    \n      Accuracy\n      0.960309\n      0.955269\n    \n    \n      F1 Score\n      0.942586\n      0.941191\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Confusion Matrix for Model 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Confusion Matrix for Model 2\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Confusion Matrix for Model 1 and Model 2\n\n\nFrom Table 1 and Figure 2, model 1 has proven to be more effective in reducing false positives. Therefore model 1 is more suitable for avoiding the mislabeling of uncontested posts. Model 1 also has a higher ROC AUC score, Accuracy, and F1 score.\nModel 1 is more effective at reducing false positives and is therefore suitable for avoiding mislabeling non-controversial posts. Model 2 is more sensitive to controversial posts and may be more useful when missing controversial posts could have a significant impact.\nThe models can guide content management strategies, and provide information for user engagement strategies. The models can also identify controversial content based on text analytics, which may help categorize the management of posts in forums.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 3: Leverage unsupervised models to divide the users into different clusters.\nIn this section, Reddit comments containing specific soccer-related keywords are selected. The study generates multiple numeric variables to quantify the frequency of these keywords within each comment. K-means algorithm is performed based on this filtered data after vectorization and standardization. In order to choose the optimal value of k in this algorithm, two different evaluation methods have been utilized, including Silhouette method and elbow method.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Silhouette Method for Optimal k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Elbow Method for Optimal k\n\n\n\n\nBased on the two line plots, the Silhouette method recommends k=5, whereas the elbow method suggests k=6. After considering both methods, k=5 is ultimately selected as the optimal value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Number of Comments Within Each Cluster \n  \n    \n      \n      prediction\n      count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0\n      162947\n    \n    \n      1\n      1\n      5885\n    \n    \n      2\n      2\n      5859\n    \n    \n      3\n      3\n      2826\n    \n    \n      4\n      4\n      2420\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above displays the distribution of each cluster, revealing a noticeable imbalance as the first cluster comprises the vast majority of comments. To further assess the clustering outcome, average feature values are computed for each cluster, and the heatmap depicting these averages is presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Cluster Feature Heatmap\n\n\n\n\nThis heatmap illustrates that certain clusters have significantly larger average values for specific features compared to others. Notably, the four smaller clusters respectively show the highest average values in ‘ligue 1,’ ‘germany,’ ‘europa,’ and ‘ballon,’ indicating a clear association between these clusters and these particular topics. As for the largest cluster, we can observe elevated values in ‘var,’ ‘transfer,’ ‘world_cup,’ and ‘coach,’ indicating the specific areas of interest for users within this cluster. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the k-means clustering method in identifying key features and categorizing Reddit comments based on specific characteristics.\n\n\nBusiness Goal 4: Predict the outcome of matches based on the text and score of comments on the same day.\nThree most popular teams are chosen to retrieve the comments of their fans on a matchday, and the match result of the team on that day are also recorded. The cleaned comments text body along with the comments’ score are input features, where the training and predicting labels are the outcome of the match on the day the comments were made. Prior to the actual machine learning section, a few preparations are done on this dataset, including vectorizing the text bodies using tokenizer and hashing into a new feature, transforming the outcomes into 1s (win) and 0s (loss), and combining the new feature and the score of each comment into the correct traning feature.\nSince only 2 outcome: win or loss are used in this machine learning study, logistic regression is the model to be trained. After the model is trained on the comment scores and the vectorized comments texts, it can then predict on the testing features. According the results of the measurements, the accuracy, precision and recall of the predictions compared to the testing labels are all around 0.7, which is a bit disappointing for a binary classification learning. According to the confusion matrix, it seems that the model is good at predicting actual wins, however when predicting losses the performance is not quite good. Thus we can conclude that the model can moderately tell the outcome of a match based on the comments and their scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Feature Importance"

Otherwise it is just a count exercise and that is not complex enough for the project.\nFeedback discussion: This suggestion provides valuable information to the audience. We took it by presenting a line plot that illustrates how the number of comments changes over time, specifically, by the hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to just the word counts for the word cloud, I am interested in seeing the TF-IDF in the future!\nFeedback discussion: We employed the significance of words as determined by the TF-IDF model rather than simply tallying word occurrences. In contrast to the original plot, this approach highlights more meaningful and relevant words.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour analysis of match to comments is good, but you only took the first step. You referenced correlation, you should continue down that track. Can you give me a metric?\nFeedback discussion: To continue down on the track of looking for the correlation, some kind of metric should also be provided. Indeed, to determine if there is a strong correlation between the number of matches and the number of comments for each day, a statistic result should be helpful. So first, the correlation coefficient is calculated, then, a scatter plot with a regression line is also shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should explain the gilded term for the reader.\nFeedback discussion: In Reddit, “gilding” refers to the act of giving an award to a user’s post or comment as a token of appreciation or recognition. We have already added this explanation in the EDA page."

The plot of single line of the positive/negative comments ratio can be more straightfoward than the plot of 2 lines of both positive and negative comments."

This creates challenges in accurately interpreting the impact of individual words. In addition, focusing on individual words may oversimplify the complex relationships in these vectors, thus detracting from our primary goal of evaluating overall model performance and predictive capability. Considering these factors, as well as the potential for misinterpretation and bias, I believe that our analyses would benefit from focusing on a broader range of performance metrics as well as the effectiveness of data preprocessing and modeling methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also plot with t-SNE.\nFeedback discussion: This is a great suggestion for visualizing the clustering result. t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that’s particularly good at preserving the local structure of the data. However, it seems that PySpark doesn’t natively support t-SNE. When we converted the dataframe to pandas in order to perform t-SNE analysis, my kernel struggled with the large amount of data. We will try to complete this part in the future development of our project.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculation at the individual comment level may make it tough to predict effectively. I might think of this as an analysis of the group of comments the day before a match as a group of comments or single large statement and then use characteristics about those comments to predict game outcome. It could be like a predict-o-meter from fans.\nFeedback discussion: Regarding this, the best way to work around is to look for the comments about 1 day or 12 hours before a match, extract the text, score, controversy as features to predict the incoming match result. This still needs some text filtering and hyper-parameter tuning to achieve a effective prediction."

It effectively removes the words with no sense and makes audiences concentrate on more important information."
