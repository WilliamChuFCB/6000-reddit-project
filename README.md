## Project Overview
This project draws on the vast and dynamic discussions about soccer in various Reddit communities. Our exploration is not just a study of the game of soccer, but a deep dive into the cultural, social, and emotional landscapes surrounding the game. At the core of our efforts is an understanding of the pulse of soccer fans around the world as captured in Reddit conversations.

Our goal was to identify the soccer topics that people talk about the most in different subreddits, from tactics and league policy to fan culture and transfers, and how these topics resonate with the Reddit community. Another key goal was to capture the sentiment of soccer fans, especially for major events like the 2022 World Cup, and track how those sentiments evolve over time. We sought to dive into the nuances of online discourse and reveal the drivers of a post’s popularity or controversy. This includes understanding what makes a post engaging or divisive among soccer fans. We are also interested in Reddit’s broader patterns of activity in the soccer community, such as which days see the most interactions and how this relates to real-world soccer events like game days.

Essentially, our project is an overview of the soccer-related digital footprint on Reddit. It seeks to analyze the collective voice of soccer fans around the world and gain insights into their preferences, emotions, and behaviors. This project not only enriches our understanding of soccer as a global phenomenon, but also demonstrates the power of online platforms like Reddit to shape and reflect public opinion and sentiment.


## Project Topics

### EDA:
1. Evaluate the relative popularity of teams and leagues by ranking the number of posts published between January 2023 and March 2023.
2. Determine which days of the week see the most activity from soccer fans, and whether this is driven by match days.
3. Identify what aspects of soccer are most frequently discussed in different subreddits and what kind of topics are most likely to acquire high scores.

### NLP:
4. Identify the teams or players linked to the highest levels of toxicity in Reddit conversations.
5. Determine if there is a relationship between the changes of sentiment in soccer subreddits and matches (e.g., wins, losses).
6. Examine how soccer fans feel about the 2022 World Cup, and how their feelings evolve over time.

### ML:
7. Predict the Popularity of Reddit Posts in Soccer Subreddits, Considering Multiple Factors.
8. Predict the outcome of upcoming games based on the sentiment or volume of the discussions before the games.
9. Develop a machine learning-based solution to predict the controversiality of social media posts using their textual content and user engagement scores.
10. Determine whether unsupervised models can be utilized to divide the users into different fan bases.
